# CS 534 Final Project

Creating an agent that plays the game Jotto

## How to build and run

Install node.js and npm on your system, then do:

```
$ npm install
```

This command should install all the necessary dependencies. This project is
written in TypeScript, a strongly typed superset of regular JavaScript. You can
compile and run the TypeScript like this:

```
$ npm run build
$ node build/main.js
```

Alternatively you can use `ts-node` to just run the TypeScript directly:

```
$ npm run start-ts
```

To run unit tests from the test folder, do:

```
$ npm run test
```

You can also lint your code with:

```
$ npm run lint
```

to ensure proper formatting.
